<h1>Best Shows of all Time According to Aditya</h1>

<h2>My top 3 shows </h2>
<hr />

<h3>Stranger Things:Upside Down</h3>
<p>There are some shows or movies you get connected to emotionally. Well Stranger things is one of them for me. 
    Well I love the way they have shown the 80s it's really cool and is very enjoyable to watch. 
    The songs are awesome and the storyline is perfect. Even if there are no ghosts in the series it's an absolute thriller. 
    I really love the show. It's absolutely one of the classics and everyone is going to remember it.
    You can see the character development from season to season.
 <br />
 For example-Steve Harrington. I also love the aura of friendship and love in the show. 
 It gives you the idea of real friends if you don't have them.
 The show shows you how important friendships are and how much your friends can help you and you can help them.

<h3>La Casa De Papel</h3>
<p>
    Rarely has a TV show inspired such widespread, global rebellion as Casa de Papel. Set in Madrid, the now-five-part series tells 
    the story of a group of robbers who steal from Spain’s Royal Mint and, later, the Bank of Spain, taking hostages along the way. 
    The whole thing is conceived and led by “El Profesor,” the almost improbably smart and well-organized fatherly figure who hatches 
    and directs the greatest robbery Spain has ever seen Twice.

I am not usually into straight action sequences, but the ones in Money Heist, as it’s called in English, are infused with the running 
themes of the show: love, friendship, bravery, and, most importantly, resistance. Gunfire-ridden combat is interspersed with rousing 
monologues from the women protagonists who do more for la revolución than any of the macho displays of physical dominance — which is 
lucky because there’s substantial badass feminist energy in this show.

<h3>House Of The Dragon</h3>

<p>
    It is very, very good. I am super-impressed with most of the actors, including the ones I had my doubts about. The story is tight, 
    tense and well-structured, the characters are clear, the situation is strong and getting stronger, and there are lots of little 
    details that are minute and/or obscure enough that you can tell the show-runners really took the care to get them right. 
    That encourages me. When shows go to a lot of effort to get the little things right that most people would give them a pass over, 
    that suggests they’ll probably get right the big calls too.

<p>
    It has a more claustrophic and less expansive focus than the first season of GOT, which is probably a good thing, and I enjoy the 
    feeling of being right in there with the characters in their struggle. The story is starting to broaden it’s context and it will 
    continue too no doubt, but starting smaller before branching out slowly was a good choice.
